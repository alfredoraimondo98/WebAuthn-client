Deep-linking demo for electron app (macOS/win32)

## Overview

This project shows the process of setting your Electron app as the default handler for a specific protocol & launch it parameterized though a URL. 

We set our app to intercept and handle any clicked URLs that start with a specific protocol - here we use ```myapp://```-. Similar to when a browser asks to be your default for viewing web pages.

## Showcase

Open Safari browser & enter ```myapp://param``` at address bar. 

Then 'electron-deep-linking-mac-win' app will start and provided url will be printed to dev console!

Project is based to [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation, then followed [‘electron-builder’ quick-setup-guide](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder#quick-setup-guide) to produce macOS/win32 installers.

## Usage

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. 

At your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/oikonomopo/electron-deep-linking-mac-win.git

# Go into the repository
cd electron-deep-linking-mac-win

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
npm start

# Produce installer
npm run dist
```
After running the installer (at electron-deep-linking-mac-win/dist/), you can try to open 'electron-deep-linking-mac-win' app with deep linking, by entering ```myapp://param``` at Safari address-bar. At chrome it will work by embedding the custom url in a link: f.e. ```<a href="myapp://param">Open app</a>```
